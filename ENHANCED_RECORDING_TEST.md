### **Step 2: Test Recording Process**
1. **Use Debug Panel** (bottom-right corner):
   - Set frequency to 440Hz
   - Click "Play" to hear reference tone
   - Click "Start Record"
   - **Watch Console**: Should see:
     ```
     🎤 Starting recording process...
     ✅ Audio context resumed
     ✅ Microphone access granted
     ✅ Using audio format: audio/webm;codecs=opus
     🎬 MediaRecorder started
     🎬 MediaRecorder.start() called
     🎵 Recording started with sample rate: 44100
     ```

2. **Sing/Hum the 440Hz tone** for 3-5 seconds
3. **Watch Console**: Should see:
   ```
   📦 Data chunk received: 4096 bytes
   📊 Total chunks: 1
   📦 Data chunk received: 4096 bytes
   📊 Total chunks: 2
   🎵 Pitch detected: {pitch: "440.2", clarity: "0.85", historyLength: 1}
   ```

4. **Click "Stop Record"**
5. **Watch Console**: Should see:
   ```
   ⏹️ Stopping recording...
   🎬 Stopping MediaRecorder...
   ⏹️ MediaRecorder stopped
   📊 Final chunks count: 25
   💾 Blob created: 102400 bytes, type: audio/webm
   🔗 Audio URL created: blob:http://localhost:5174/abc-123-def
   ```

### **Step 3: Test Playback**
1. **Check Debug Panel**: Should show "✅ Recording Ready"
2. **Click "Play Recording"**
3. **Watch Console**: Should see:
   ```
   ▶️ Starting playback of recording...
   🔗 Audio URL: blob:http://localhost:5174/abc-123-def
   📊 Audio loaded - Duration: 3.5 seconds
   ✅ Audio can start playing
   ▶️ Playback started
   ⏹️ Playback ended
   ```

4. **Listen**: Should hear your recorded voice clearly

### **Step 4: Test Download Feature**
1. **Click "Download Recording"** in debug panel
2. **Check Downloads**: Should download a .webm file
3. **Play Downloaded File**: Verify it contains your voice

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **✅ Success Indicators**
- **Console Shows Data Chunks**: `📦 Data chunk received: XXXX bytes`
- **Blob Size > 0**: `💾 Blob created: XXXXX bytes`
- **Audio URL Created**: `🔗 Audio URL created: blob:...`
- **Playback Works**: Can hear your recorded voice
- **Download Works**: File downloads and plays correctly

### **❌ Problem Indicators**
- **No Data Chunks**: Console doesn't show `📦 Data chunk received`
- **Empty Blob**: `💾 Blob created: 0 bytes`
- **No Audio URL**: Missing `🔗 Audio URL created`
- **Playback Fails**: Console shows `❌ Playback error`
- **No Sound**: Can't hear recorded voice

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Issue: No Data Chunks**
**Symptoms**: Console shows `🎬 MediaRecorder started` but no `📦 Data chunk received`
**Solutions**:
- Check microphone permissions
- Try different browser (Chrome works best)
- Check if microphone is muted
- Try speaking louder

### **Issue: Empty Blob**
**Symptoms**: `💾 Blob created: 0 bytes`
**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're speaking during recording
- Check microphone levels
- Try longer recording (5+ seconds)
- Check browser console for errors

### **Issue: Playback Fails**
**Symptoms**: `❌ Playback error` in console
**Solutions**:
- Check if audio URL is valid (starts with `blob:`)
- Try downloading the file first
- Check browser audio settings
- Try different audio format

### **Issue: No Sound During Playback**
**Symptoms**: Playback starts but no sound
**Solutions**:
- Check computer volume
- Check browser audio settings
- Try downloading and playing file externally
- Check if audio is muted
